# Greetings!

Welcome to my [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought)! My name is Leonardo Kamogawa, a [Japanese Brazilian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Brazilians) currently living in Brazil and part of the micro-generation labelled [Zillennial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zillennials), which explains why my first contact with game emulation was through a Game Boy Advance emulator with a Pokémon Ruby ROM (unofficially translated to Brazilian Portuguese) in a 3.5″ Floppy Disk.

I like doing lots of different things and thinking about all kinds of stuff. One of these thoughts is that starting a website to share my achievements (and failures) is an excellent way to stimulate my creativity, to keep learning and to tame my [monkey mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_mind).

**Hyperpyrus** is where I will publish what I want to share on the internet. It can be [[notes/index|Notes]] about topics that I am studying, long-form [[essays/index|Essays]] of specific subjects, tentative of being philosophical with inner thoughts [[daydreams/index|Daydreams]], [[reviews/index|Reviews]] of things that I liked or disliked, artworks made by me on my [[vernissage/index|Vernissage]], and [[misc/index|More]]!

As this garden grows, you will know more about *The Life and Opinions of Leonardo Kamogawa, Gentleman*.

# What I do

I graduated with a degree in mathematics from [São Paulo State University](https://www.international.unesp.br/), and currently I am working as a full-time Data Scientist.
Also, I am available for freelance jobs, and I am willing to contribute on Open-Source projects.

If you want to know more about *The Work and Projects of Leonardo Kamogawa, [Salaryman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salaryman)*, take a look at my [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) website, [lkamogawa.com](lkamogawa.com).

# I want to make a digital garden too!

Feel free to explore this website and its [source code](https://github.com/LKamogawa/hyperpyrus).

Visit the [Quartz](https://github.com/LKamogawa/hyperpyrus) website and follow the guide. The tutorial for building a default Quartz website is easy to follow, even if you have very basic knowledge of programming. And you can use some LLM to help you.

**It's never been easier to create a website than it used to be!**

### Thank you for visiting Hyperpyrus.
