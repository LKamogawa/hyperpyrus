title: Misc
---
I've defined five folders to categorise my posts: [[content/notes/index|Notes]], [[content/essays/index|Essays]], [[content/daydreams/index|Daydreams]], [[content/reviews/index|Reviews]] and [[content/vernissage/index|Vernissage]].
I'd like to stick with only these five folders, so the “Misc” category will be the wildcard place for posts that doesn't fit anywhere.
