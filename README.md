# Hyperpyrus

All files to build my digital garden, [Hyperpyrus](https://hyperpyrus.lkamogawa.com), are here! I've used [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) to transform them into a beautiful static website.

If you want to build one too, check the links below on the original Quartz README.

Quartz is a set of tools that helps you publish your [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought) and notes as a website for free.
