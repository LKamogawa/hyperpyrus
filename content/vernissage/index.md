A [Vernissage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernissage) is an event that occurs before the grand opening of an art exhibition so invited guests can see and appreciate the artists making the final touches in their artworks, like varnishing (in French, *vernissage*) them.
I'm not an artist, but I (think that I) am a creative person. So I invite you to my own ***Vernissage***!
